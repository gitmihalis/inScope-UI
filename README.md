## In Scope reddit clone
A node JS reddit clone but with a twist
- timestamps of posts are used to position them on a timeline within a scope
- scopes consist of timestamps between a start and end date
- posts in scope with the same date are stacked ontop of each other,
  - you navigate these posts by swiping horizontally through them ( carousel )
  - most upvoted posts are at the top of the carousel

.. in development
